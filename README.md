# ra-data-treeql
ðŸª„ [React Admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin) data provider and UI scaffolder for [TreeQL](https://treeql.org/)-powered REST APIs like [PHP-CRUD-API](https://github.com/mevdschee/php-crud-api).

It is not only a data provider for your API, but it can also (optionally) generate the UI for all your tables and columns automatically, similarly to [`api-platform` admin](https://github.com/api-platform/admin) .

## Motivation

The first reason I was motivated to do this was to quickly prototype an admin tool for a work-in-progress SQL DB schema that was still uncertain. I didn't want to worry about adapting the UI views whenever the DB schema changed, that would be a big waste of time until I had the final version of the schema.
I also didn't want to invest time on building a RESTFul API yet.

Possible use cases:

- Having an almost zero-coding quick way to display and manage data in SQL-based databases.
- Building your own simple but highly customizable headless CMS, with e.g. just a SQLite DB file.
- Prototyping admin tools and dashboards without worrying too much about building APIs for them, and without having to change the admin UI whenever the DB schema changes (which is very often when it's still being defined).
- Prototyping an internal support tool for your company without worrying too much whenever a microservice changes its underlaying DB schema, without waiting for them to create API endpoints (as abstraction layers).

## Installation

```
npm i ra-data-treeql
```

## Requirements

- An API based on [php-crud-api](https://github.com/mevdschee/php-crud-api) or compatible. Alternatively, any [TreeQL](https://treeql.org) implementation that also exposes a `/columns` endpoint like php-crud-api does. If you don't need the scaffolding part, you don't need to have a `/columns` endpoint in the implementation of TreeQL of your choice.
- A React or React + NextJS app (with TypeScript) to embed the admin component in

## Configuring php-crud-api

Just make sure that you enable at least the `records` and `columns` routes.

Example, embedded in a Symfony 5.x controller:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Presentation\Http\Controller;

use Nyholm\Psr7\Factory\Psr17Factory;
use Symfony\Bridge\PsrHttpMessage\Factory\HttpFoundationFactory;
use Symfony\Bridge\PsrHttpMessage\Factory\PsrHttpFactory;
use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\AbstractController;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\Annotation\Route;
use Tqdev\PhpCrudApi\Api;
use Tqdev\PhpCrudApi\Config;

class ApiController extends AbstractController
{
    private const OPENAPI_BASE = [
        "info" => [
            "title" => "DB API",
            "version" => "1.0.0",
            "description" => "DB as a RESTFul API",
        ],
        "servers" => [
            [
                "url" => "http://localhost:1234/api",
                "description" => "Localhost",
            ],
        ],
        "schemes" => [
            "http",
        ],
        "x-meta" => ["foo" => "bar"],  // TODO might be useful to generate metadata for your react-admin implementation
    ];

    public function __construct(private readonly string $databaseFile)
    {
    }

    #[Route('/api{params}', name: 'api_route', requirements: ['params' => '.+'])]
    public function index(Request $symfonyRequest): Response
    {
        // Convert the symfonyRequest to a psrRequest
        $psr17Factory = new Psr17Factory();
        $psrHttpFactory = new PsrHttpFactory(
            $psr17Factory, $psr17Factory,
            $psr17Factory, $psr17Factory
        );
        $psrRequest = $psrHttpFactory->createRequest($symfonyRequest);

        // PHP-CRUD-API takes a psrRequest and generates a psrResponse
        $config = new Config(
            [
                'driver' => 'sqlite',
                'address' => $this->databaseFile,
                'controllers' => 'records,columns,openapi,status', // default is 'records,geojson,openapi,status',
                'basePath' => '/api', // Same as the Symfony controller route
                "openApiBase" => json_encode(self::OPENAPI_BASE, JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR),
                'cors.allowHeaders' => ['*'], // You can also whiltelist them. Left as * for quick prototyping.
            ]
        );
        $api = new Api($config);
        $psrResponse = $api->handle($psrRequest);

        // Convert the psrResponse to a symfonyResponse
        return (new HttpFoundationFactory())->createResponse($psrResponse);
    }
}

```

## Usage

### Embedding in a regular React app

`components/ReactAdmin.tsx`
```tsx
import {MyDashboardPanel} from "./dashboard"
import {AdminGuesser} from "ra-data-treeql"
import {fetchUtils} from "ra-core"


const ReactAdmin = () => {
  const apiUrl = process.env.API_URL || 'http://localhost:1234/api'

  return (
    <AdminGuesser
      apiUrl={apiUrl}
      httpClient={fetchUtils.fetchJson}
      excludedTables={[
        "sqlite_sequence",
        "doctrine_migration_versions",
        "migrations"
      ]}
      adminProps={{
        title: 'My React Admin',
        dashboard: MyDashboardPanel,
      }}/>
  )
}

export default ReactAdmin
```

### Embedding in a NextJS app

`components/ReactAdmin.tsx`
```tsx

import {MyDashboardPanel} from "./dashboard"
import {AdminGuesser} from "ra-data-treeql"
import {fetchUtils} from "ra-core"


const ReactAdmin = () => {
  const apiUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:1234/api'

  return (
    <AdminGuesser
      apiUrl={apiUrl}
      httpClient={fetchUtils.fetchJson}
      excludedTables={[
        "sqlite_sequence",
        "doctrine_migration_versions",
        "migrations"
      ]}
      adminProps={{
        title: 'My React Admin',
        dashboard: MyDashboardPanel,
      }}/>
  )
}

export default ReactAdmin
```

`pages/admin.tsx`
```tsx
import dynamic from "next/dynamic"

/**
 * This page cannot be Server-side rendered, so NextJS has to explicitly declare it as a dynamic page.
 *
 * @see https://marmelab.com/react-admin/CustomApp.html
 * @see https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/issues/4158
 * @see https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import#with-no-ssr
 * @see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65629726/react-admin-with-next-js
 * @see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55399118/how-to-remove-hash-from-routes-in-react-admin-framework
 */
//
const ReactAdmin = dynamic(() => import("../components/ReactAdmin"), {
  ssr: false,
})

const HomePage = () => <ReactAdmin/>

export default HomePage
```
